STCubeMX LoRaWAN stack template

Built using v1.2.1 of ST's LoRaWAN Stack

Visual Studio Code Template for STM32 with Black Magic Probe

A basic template app that contains the following:

All Intellisense configuration for STM32CubeMX HAL
All Path configuration for STM32CubeMX HAL

A very basic printf-like function that can be directed to a UART of your choice that can be #defined away

The following tasks:
Make - builds the embedded application using the CubeMX generated Makefile
Clean - cleans the embedded application
Monitor - opens a PuTTY session using the Black Magic Probe's builtin Virtual Serial Port
Flash - uses the Black Magic Probe to load the built .elf file on the target

GDB Debugging configuration in launch.json

Assumes the use of the following:
Windows
VSCode for IDE
STM32CubeMX for code generation
GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain for compiling/debugging
MSYS2 for Windows Version of Make
Black Magic Probe for JTAG/SWD/Flashing
PuTTY for serial port monitoring

Much of the work here is based on the following previous work of others

This blog details the setup of the debugger

Right now, the only tested configurations with the following hardware setups:
Windows 10 - Black Magic Probe 2.1 Offical Hardware - STM32 Clicker 2 from Mikroelecktronica
(WIP) Windows 10 - Black Magic Probe 2.1 Offical Hardware - STM32 "Blue Pill"
Windows 10 - Black Magic Probe 2.1 Offical Harware - Open103z from Waveshare

Paths and COM port numbers will have to be adjusted if you use this for your system

Hope this is helpful to anyone else
